S_WARPDRIVE_DESC: <<
	Allows the station to make [b]small[/b] subspace jumps to other locations within range using jump drive technology. Larger warp drive subsystems allow for larger safe jump distances.

	Jumping outside of safe jump range is possible, but can cause damage to the station and may drop the station at an location away from the intended destination.

	Warpdrives require a large amount of [b]Control[/b] for the jump calculations.
