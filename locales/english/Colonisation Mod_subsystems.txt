S_WARPDRIVE_DESC: <<
	Allows the station to make [b]small[/b] subspace jumps to other locations within range using jump drive technology. Larger warp drive subsystems allow for larger safe jump distances.

	Jumping outside of safe jump range is possible, but can cause damage to the station and may drop the station at an location away from the intended destination.

	Warpdrives require a large amount of [b]Control[/b] for the jump calculations.

SPARSE_SUPPLY_MODULE_DESC: <<
	Stores the bare minimum of resources to provide supplies and ammunition for use in combat and sieging planets.

	[img=AttributeIcons::4;22]Provides [b][color=#fefc61]Supply Capacity[/color][/b].[/img]
	[img=Plus]Low maintenence cost.[/img]
	[img=Minus]No supply regeneration even in friendly space[/img]
	[img=Minus]Destroyed supply storage hexes leak supplies over time at a very fast rate.[/img]
	Recommended for use with the Bussard Ramjet or Emergency Supplies subsystems to recover supply.

CANNOT_MIX_SUPPLIES: $1 is not allowed with Supply Storage
SHIP_LOW_POWER_COMPUTER_NAME: Low Power Computer
SHIP_LOW_POWER_COMPUTER_DESC: <<
	An autonomous low power computer capable of controlling a small number of ship systems.

	[img=ActionBarIcons::0;22;#00ff80]Provides a small amount of [b][color=#00ff80]Control[/color][/b] to operate other subsystems.[/img]
	[img=Plus]Very low maintenece cost.[/img]
	[img=Minus]Does not repair the vessel.[/img]
	[img=Minus]Ship is destroyed if no control remains.[/img]
	[img=MenuIcons::3;20]Requires more power and maintenence than a standard Control Computer per control given.[/img]
