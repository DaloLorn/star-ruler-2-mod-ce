S_WARPDRIVE_DESC: <<
	Allows the station to make [b]small[/b] subspace jumps to other locations within range using enlarged and less sophisticated jumpdrive technology. Larger warp drive subsystems allow for larger safe jump distances.

	Jumping outside of safe jump range is possible, but can cause damage to the station and may drop the station at an location away from the intended destination.

	Warpdrives require a large amount of [b]Control[/b] for the jump calculations.

SPARSE_SUPPLY_MODULE_DESC: <<
	NOT IN USE, NEEDS REWORK

	Stores the bare minimum of resources to provide supplies and ammunition for use in combat and sieging planets.

	[img=AttributeIcons::4;22]Provides [b][color=#fefc61]Supply Capacity[/color][/b].[/img]
	[img=Plus]Low maintenence cost.[/img]
	[img=Minus]No supply regeneration even in friendly space[/img]
	[img=Minus]Destroyed supply storage hexes leak supplies over time at a very fast rate.[/img]
	Recommended for use with the Bussard Ramjet or Emergency Supplies subsystems to recover supply.

SHIP_LOW_POWER_COMPUTER_NAME: Low Power Computer
SHIP_LOW_POWER_COMPUTER_DESC: <<
	An autonomous low power computer capable of controlling a small number of ship systems.

	[img=Plus]No maintenece cost.[/img]
	[img=Minus]Uses a lot of space to provide adequate control.[/img]
	[img=Minus]Does not repair the vessel.[/img]
	[img=Minus]Ship is destroyed if no control remains.[/img]

S_EXPLORATION_HULL: Exploration Hull
S_EXPLORATION_HULL_DESC: <<
	A hull specifically designed to field small exploration and scientific vessels.

	[img=Plus]Maintenence costs reduced by 66%.[/img]
	[img=Plus]More internal space available.[/img]
	[img=Plus]Reduced mass of ship.[/img]
	[img=Minus]Cannot have any weapons or support comand on the ship.[/img]
	[img=Minus]Ship is more fragile.[/img]
	[img=MenuIcons::3;20][i][color=#aaa]Exploration Hulls can only be used on ships of size 300 or less.[/color][/i][/img]

ERROR_MAX_SIZE: $1 has maximum size $2.
NEED_ONE_PROCESSOR: $1 must have exactly one Processor on the ship
S_RAMJET_DESC: <<
	Collects stray particles from the vacuum while moving by means of an enormous magnetic field leading into a scoop at the front of the ship, then uses those particles to generate thrust.

	[img=Plus]Greatly reduces the maintenance cost of the ship.[/img]
	[img=Plus]Restores the ship's [b]Supply[/b] when at high velocity. The full indicated Supply Gain rate is reached at speeds of 100 u/s or more.[/img]
	[img=Minus]Provides lower Thrust than conventional engines.[/img]

	Each Ramjet must contain at least one [color=#da8a9f][b]Ramscoop[/b][/color], pointing outwards at the front of the ship. One Ramjet on the ship must contain one [color=#da8a9f][b]Processor[/b][/color]. You can find these under the [color=#eda1ff][b]Modifiers[/b][/color] category.
>>
S_RAMJET_PROCESSOR: Ramjet Processor
S_RAMJET_PROCESSOR_DESC: Processes stray particles collected by Ramscoops to reduce ship maintence costs.
S_SOLARPANEL_DESC: <<
	Solar Panels are a cheap and efficient way to provide power for subsystems, but rely on being near a star to operate.

	[img=ResourceIcon::2;22]Provides [b][color=#42b4bd]Power[/color][/b] to operate other subsystems.[/img]
	[img=Plus]No maintainece cost[/img]
	[img=Minus]Slightly decreases combat strength when fighting near stars with low luminosity.[/img]
	[img=Minus]Significantly decreases combat strength when fighting in deep space.[/img]
	[img=Minus]Solar Panels must be placed on the exterior of the ship.[/img]

S_MINING_HULL: Mining Hull
S_MINING_HULL_DESC: <<
	A hull specifically designed to field mining vessels.

	[img=Plus]Maintenence costs reduced by 66%.[/img]
	[img=Plus]Build and labor costs reduced by 66%.[/img]
	[img=Plus]Mining rate increased by 20%.[/img]
	[img=Minus]Cannot have any weapons or support comand on the ship.[/img]
	[img=Minus]Ship is extremely fragile.[/img]
	[img=MenuIcons::3;20][i][color=#aaa]Mining Hulls can only be used on ships with Mining Lasers.[/color][/i][/img]
>>
ERROR_MUST_HAVE_MINING_LASER: $1 must have a Mining Laser
ERROR_MUST_HAVE_AT_LEAST_ONE_STACK_FOR_BOMBARDMENT: Carpet Bomb too small
S_POWER_AMPLIFIER: Power Amplifier
S_POWER_AMPLIFIER_DESC: <<
	Refined manufactoring processes can increase the power generation of the subsystem, but they do not come cheaply.

	[img=Plus]Increases the [b][color=#80ffea]power generation[/color][/b] of the subsystem by 25%.[/img]
	[img=Minus]Increases the build cost of the subsystem.[/img]
	[i][color=#aaa]Placing more than one power amplifier on a subsystem will continue to increase its power generation, but will skyrocket its build cost.[/color][/i]
