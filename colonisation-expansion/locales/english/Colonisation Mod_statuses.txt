	This is a mothership, and is currently carrying population.

	Motherships can construct things with labor. When in orbit of a planet with labor, the mothership gains that labor.

	Planetary resources can be exploited by building habitats around planets to offload population into.

	Every population currently living on this mothership increases your income by ยง15k and labor by 1.
