TRAIT_PARASITE: Parasite
TRAIT_PARASITE_DESC: <<
	[vspace=3/][img=Revolutionaries;22]All owned planets produce only 50% of the pressure of their resources. Planets can be razed down to nothing to massively increase their resource production before destroying their resources.[/img]
	[vspace=3/] [img=ResourceIcon::8;22]Planet colony ships from planets not being razed move 75% slower.[/img]
>>
TRAIT_SUBLIGHT_DESC: We have not discovered any means to break the lightspeed barrier. No FTL drive, FTL generation, or FTL storage. FTL can be still be researched from in game actions but takes considerable resources.
TRAIT_JUMPDRIVE_DESC: <<
	Ships are equipped with jump drives that let them cheaply jump to positions within their safe jump range.

	Jumping outside of safe jump range is possible, but can cause damage to the ship and may drop the ship at an location away from the intended destination.
>>
TRAIT_WARPDRIVE_DESC: <<
	Unlocks the Warpdrive subsystem (for stations) at game start. This FTL technology can be taken additively with other FTL methods

Planets cannot construct anything.[/img] [vspace=3/][img=ResourceIcon::6;22]Resources are produced in orbit, no pressure capacity is needed. Motherships in orbit of a planet automatically gain that planet's labor income. [/img][vspace=3/][img=PlanetType::14;22]Artifical planetoids, ringworlds and planets with native population can construct buildings, develop tiles and grow population, but do not produce all resources from pressure automatically and still cannot export labor.[/img]
WALKING: Walking
TRAIT_TERRESTIAL_DESC: No particular effects on gameplay
WALKING_DESC: No particular bonuses.
AQUATIC_TRAIT: All colonised planets with water biomes become happy. Development and building construction rates reduced 20%. Fire damage taken on ships is doubled.

	[color=#f00]NO AI SUPPORT[/color]

	Why venture into outer space when you can bring your home with you?
	[vspace=6/][img=PlanetThruster * 44ffbb;22]Special Planetary Engines are constructed on all colonised planets, with 1.5 u/sÂ² of acceleration and no cost. These cannot be removed except by losing the planet.[/img]
	[vspace=6/][img=ResourceIcon::8;22]Colonise planets by bringing other planets to them[/img]
	[vspace=6/][img=ResourceIcon::6;22]Resources cannot be traded. Instead, resources are transfered between nearby planets[/img]
	[vspace=3/] [img=AttributeIcons::3;22]Fleets operate at 70% efficiency while nearby owned planets, but only 20% efficiency far away. This debuff does not apply to stations.[/img]
	[vspace=6/][img=techConstruction * #30a67a;22][b]Station Sustenance[/b] is unlocked from the start and can be unlocked again (multiplying orbital maintenance decreases), replacing Megacities.[/img]
	[vspace=6/][img=PlanetThruster;22][b]Planetary Engine[/b] building is available from the start.[/img]

CELESTIAL: Battleworlders
TRAIT_SCIENTIFIC: Scientific
TRAIT_SCIENTIFIC_DESC: Start the game with 1 additional research income per second.
TRAIT_WORMHOLE: Wormhole Network
TRAIT_WORMHOLE_DESC: Civillian ships in owned space passively spawn small wormholes connecting your systems and planets together.
TRAIT_DIPLOMATIC: Diplomatic

TRAIT_DECENTRALISED: Decentralised
TRAIT_DECENTRALISED_DESC: Loyalty on planets is reduced by 0/1/3/5/7/9 depending on level.
TRAIT_LIGHT: Light
TRAIT_LIGHT_DESC: All ship mass reduced by 10%. This reduces mass based FTL costs and increases acceleration.
TRAIT_HEAVY: Heavy
TRAIT_HEAVY_DESC: All ship mass increased by 15%. This increases mass based FTL costs and reduces acceleration.
