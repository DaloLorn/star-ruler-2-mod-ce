BLD_CELESTIAL_PLANET_ENGINE_DESC: <<
	A ludicrously large thruster constructed on the planet's surface allows the planet to accelerate itself slightly.

	Gives the planet 1.25 u/sÂ² of acceleration to move with.
>>
BLD_DEFENSE_GRID_DESC: <<
	A massive field of missile silos located on the surface of the planet, capable of firing at nearby enemy fleets.

	The grid is composed of 10 missile launchers totaling 250 DPS with 450 range.

	[i]Devastation from carpet bombing is reduced to 20% effectiveness[/i]
>>
BLD_PLANET_CANNON_DESC: <<
	An enormous railgun on the planet's surface propels large projectiles towards enemy fleets in the system, inflicting damage. Also propels support satellites into orbit adding 2 local defense generation.

	The cannon deals 200 Damage every 5 seconds at 1500 range.

BLD_MINING_COMPLEX: Mining Complex
BLD_MINING_COMPLEX_DESC: <<
	This massive asteroid refinement complex grants planets the ability to refine ore directly, at a rapid rate.

	Requires a Planetary Thruster to be present.
>>
BLD_ANCIENT_REINFORCER_REV_DESC: <<
	All your ships have 7% increased repair rates and systems that repair have 25% more mass.

	[bbloc=#TIP_CONSUME_BASE_MATERIAL:10/]


	[i][color=#aaa]Alas, while the Reinforcer was neither overpowered, not utterly useless, it had to be reworked anyway, for what it lacked in meta defining functionality it certainly made up for in its capability to leak design revisions all over the place and bloat save files beyond what multiplayer could manage. A horrific way to never lose, if I'm winning I won't build this, and if I'm losing I'll stop the game. The Reinforcer was not unique in this power, but its cousins could be salvaged with creative workarounds to retain their effects. The Reinforcer simply could not. So it had to go, and in its place is a spiritual successor that will hopefully carve out its own niche and identity without the fangs of its parent.[/color][/i]

BLD_ANCIENT_REINFORCER_REV: Reinforcer II
BLD_FARM_REV_DESC: <<
	Generates a basic unexportable food resource.

	[i][color=#aaa]More expensive than maintaining a food planet.[/color][/i]

BLD_HYDROGENATOR_REV_DESC: <<
	Generates a basic unexportable water resource.

	[i][color=#aaa]More expensive than maintaining a water planet.[/color][/i]
>>
BLD_BARRACKS_REV_DESC: <<
	Adds 15 Defense Reserve to your global pool.

	When your defense reserve is full, it can be deployed at any time to one of your planets to spawn defense ships.
>>
BLD_METROPOLIS_REV_DESC: <<
	A large urban area covering and connecting multiple smaller population centers.

	Replaces up to 5 regular cities.

	Increases the planet's total pressure capacity by 5.
>>
BLD_RESEARCHCOMPLEX_REV_DESC: <<
	Generates research points for the empire, and provides training and resources to civil scientists.

	Gives 1 research generation.
	Adds 1 research pressure.
>>
BLD_WAREHOUSE_REV_DESC: <<
	Adds 100 Labor Storage.

	Labor storage fills up when not building anything, and empties as extra labor for construction projects.
>>
BLD_SPACE_ELEVATOR_DESC: <<
	A ribbon-like tether reaching vertically into space can be used to significantly increase the efficiency of transporting materials into space.

	Increases the construction speed of support ships on this planet by 40%, and increases the maximum support capacity of the planet by 256.

	Only one Space Elevator may be constructed per planet.
>>

	The grid is composed of 10 missile launchers totaling 500 DPS with 1000 range.

	[i]Devastation from carpet bombing is reduced to 20% effectiveness[/i]
>>
BLD_MUSEUM_DESC: <<
	When built, immediately grants 10 bonus influence points.

	Increases the planet's influence generation by 1 stake.

	Cannot be removed once built.
>>
THERMAL_REGULATOR_DESC: <<
	All your ships have 4% increased efficiency.

	[i][color=#aaa]Designed to operate at nearly 0K, these planet sized thermal regulators are an enigma to the lucky few scientists that get a chance to study them. They seem to act as a heat sink for flagships and stations, pulling heat away from their electrical components to allow them to operate more efficiently. If these regulators have a maximum range no one has found it.

	The builders seem to understand laws of nature about temperature that no one else can comprehend. Fortunately the buildings are not too difficult to adapt to more conventional operating temperatures once acquired.[/color][/i]
