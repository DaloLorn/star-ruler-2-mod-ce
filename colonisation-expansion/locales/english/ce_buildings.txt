	[i][color=#aaa]Alas, while the Reinforcer was neither overpowered, not utterly useless, it had to be reworked anyway, for what it lacked in meta defining functionality it certainly made up for in its capability to leak design revisions all over the place and bloat save files beyond what multiplayer could manage. A horrific way to never lose, if I'm winning I won't build this, and if I'm losing I'll stop the game. The Reinforcer was not unique in this power, but its cousins could be salvaged with creative workarounds to retain their effects. The Reinforcer simply could not. So it had to go, and in its place is a spiritual successor that will hopefully carve out its own niche and identity without the fangs of its parent.[/color][/i]
