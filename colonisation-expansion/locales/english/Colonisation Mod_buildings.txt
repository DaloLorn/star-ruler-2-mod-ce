BLD_CELESTIAL_PLANET_ENGINE_DESC: <<
	A ludicrously large thruster constructed on the planet's surface allows the planet to accelerate itself slightly.

	Gives the planet 1 u/sÂ² of acceleration to move with. Multiple planetary thrusters further increase acceleration.

	We seem to be a bit obsessed with moving planets; this thruster cannot be removed.
