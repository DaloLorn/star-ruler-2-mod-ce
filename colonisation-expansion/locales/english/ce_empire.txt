RACE_WANDI_LORE: <<|
	Exiled on some no name planet. Forbidden from making ships or even satellites. Did we give up?

	No!

	We made our prison a home. We fled the empire without ever setting foot off our planet. We made our home move.

	Why crowd into ships now that we are free? We have wandered the universe for generations.

	Yet we see movement beyond the skies. We have wandered into an occupied galaxy. To protect our way of life we will have to venture into space once more.

	Can we be held responsible for not defying our nature?

	Are we doomed just for existing?

	Great expansion and greater contraction is all we know. All we can know.

	Is it our fault we raze everything down to rock? We cannot live any other way.

	Our great tree has drawn its last breath. We must expand to new worlds, for this one no longer has food.

	Is that so wrong?

	We just want to live.

HELP_BATTLEWORLDERS: <<
	[font=Big]Battleworlders[/font][vspace=4/]
	You've chosen to play as a race with the [color=#aaffaa]Battleworlder[/color] trait. Here's a few quick tips to get you started!
	[color=#aaa][i]Access this window at any time by pressing the [img=MenuIcons::3;22/] button on the right side of the screen.[/i][/color]

	[font=Medium]Planets[/font][vspace=4/]
	[color=#ccc]All your planets are automatically outfitted with special planetary engines and can move once they are built. Planetary Thrusters are already unlocked and can be used to further increase the speed of your planets. Defense generation will spawn Support Satellites around planets instead of Support Ships[/color]

	[font=Medium]Colonisation[/font][vspace=4/]
	[color=#ccc]You cannot send colony ships, to colonise planets you must send other planets to them. This also means colonising does not cost you money.[/color]

	[font=Medium]Resources[/font][vspace=4/]
	[color=#ccc]You cannot trade resources, but you can transfer resources between your planets if they are close together. You cannot transfer scalable, non exportable or tier 3 resources off planets. You can still transfer other resources onto such planets.[/color]

	[font=Medium]Battle[/font][vspace=4/]
	[color=#ccc]Your ships become weak when in regions without owned planets or when far from any owned planets in deep space. Orbitals are not weakened.[/color]
	[color=#ccc]You can build orbitals within a planet's gravitational field to move them with the planet.[/color]
	[color=#ccc]You can take out early remnants with battleworlds if you build up a support fleet and enable defense for the planet.[/color]

	[font=Medium]Deep Space[/font][vspace=4/]
	[color=#ccc]Sending planets into deep space will drop them to level 0 if they do not have Lighting Systems.[/color]

	[font=Medium]FTL[/font][vspace=4/]
	[color=#ccc]If you're using Slipstreams or Gates, remember you can send planets through them! A planet cannot enter a gate orbiting it, but it can enter slipstreams created in orbit.[/color]

HELP_FROSTKIN: <<
	[font=Big]Frostkin[/font][vspace=4/]
	You've chosen to play as a race with the [color=#ffc1d5]Frostkin[/color] trait. Here's a few quick tips to get you started!
	[color=#aaa][i]Access this window at any time by pressing the [img=MenuIcons::3;22/] button on the right side of the screen.[/i][/color]

	[font=Medium]Stars[/font][vspace=4/]
	[color=#ccc]You need to freeze or otherwise destroy stars before you can colonise planets around them. Star Eater subsystems are most effective since they destroy stars safely, but you can also use other weapons like Gravitron Condensors in the late game. It is still possible to claim systems before you can settle them via Outposts.[/color]

	[font=Medium]Energy[/font][vspace=4/]
	[color=#ccc]Most means of generating energy from starlight are not available, but you can use stolen stellar infrastructure from other empires.[/color]

	[font=Medium]Cooling[/font][vspace=4/]
	[color=#ccc]You can construct one Thermal Regulator per planet to grant empire wide fleet strength buffs. However, other empires can also steal these buildings from you. Thermal Regulators replace the resource on the planet they are constructed at so are best suited to level 0 planets.[/color]
