	Congratulations recruit, you've almost made your way to becoming a commander
	of the Terra expedition force. Over the last few centuries we've had a number
	of mutinies and minor squabbles, so we introduced some mandatory dogfight
	training for all commanders.

	Your task is very simple. Win an outmatched dogfight in our simulator
	to prove your skills.

	As you can see, it's 3 versus 2 and your ships are identical to the enemy.
	You're going to need to get behind their ships or focus down the ship on
	its own with both of yours.

DOGFIGHT_TRAINING_INTRO2_TITLE: Goal
DOGFIGHT_TRAINING_INTRO2_TEXT: <<|
	You complete the simulation when all enemy ships are destroyed. You lose
	if you run out of ships first.

	Nicely done! One more enemy ship to go and your ships will level up making
	them stronger. In the mean time, you should regroup and let your ships
	recover.

	Hyperdrives are very useful for quick getaways! Shame we can't
	work out how to build them ourselves.

	Now you're out of harm's way you should take advantage of the support fleet
    building up on your planets. Transfer them to your ships to get an edge for
    the last battle.

MINING_COLONY_PLAYER_EMP: 5th Terra Expedition
MINING_COLONY_ALLY_EMP: Terra Mining Colony
MINING_COLONY_ENEMY_EMP: Vultri
// A mining colony from a previous Terra expedition have been
// pleading for help to defend themselves again an onslaught of robots
// No one else wanted to try out our new Terra manufactured prototype
// hyperdrives so you're up. The colony say the robots are very vulnerable to
// planetary bombardment, so we've hooked your fleets up with loads of the stuff.
// You'll have to carve out your own trade network from the systems you siege
// Keep in mind that until you get a factory up and running you won't be able
// to replace any lost fleets so you'll have to engage carefully.

MINING_COLONY_NAME: Mining Colony Attack
MINING_COLONY_DESC: <<|
	[b]2463 CE:[/b]

	[i]The following message was received from the Terra mining colony directed
	to the commander of the 5th Terra Expedition.[/i]

	[offset=20][color=#ddd]
	It's crazy out here! One shift we were directing some mining ships remotely
	and the next half our fleet was gone and we've lost some of our mining
	bases. Please get rid of these invaders.

	They won't even communicate with us. We sent a message over radio waves
	to ask what they wanted and all they replied with was "Vultri". We could
	have saved ourselves a small fortune if we didn't bother taking a universal
	translator.

	If you don't come soon we'll have to evacuate and that will [b]not[/b]
	go down well with your superiors. I don't care if you're supposed to be
	leading some kind of expedition. You're the only commander willing to
	travel through hyperspace and we don't have the time for a sublight
	response.

MINING_COLONY_INTRO_TITLE: Mining Colony Rescue
MINING_COLONY_INTRO_TEXT: <<|
	[i]General Nova:[/i]

	You've been assigned 5 state of the art hyperdrive fleets to take back
	control of the mining base. Losing a few more mining colonies in the
	conflict is fine but if you lose all of them we'll be in serious trouble.

MINING_COLONY_INTRO2_TITLE: Tips and tricks
MINING_COLONY_INTRO2_TEXT: <<|
	[i]General Nova:[/i]

	The colonists have informed us that the invaders are particularly
	vulnerable to planetary bombardment, so each of your fleets are loaded
	with the stuff. I recommend bombarding their tier 1 and 2 planets
	immediately to delevel them and weaken the invaders' economy.

MINING_COLONY_LOST_TITLE: In retreat
MINING_COLONY_LOST_TEXT: <<|
	[i]General Nova:[/i]

	Aaargh! I said we'd be in trouble if we lost all the mining colonies.
	The politicians back home decided to cut our funding way back. I'm going
	to have to take a huge pay cut for this. Oh, how about you? You're fired.
