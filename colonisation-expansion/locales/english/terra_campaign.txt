	Congratulations recruit, you've almost made your way to becoming a commander
	of the Terra expedition force. Over the last few centuries we've had a number
	of mutinies and minor squabbles, so we introduced some mandatory dogfight
	training for all commanders.

	Your task is very simple. Win an outmatched dogfight in our simulator
	to prove your skills.

	As you can see, it's 3 versus 2 and your ships are identical to the enemy.
	You're going to need to get behind their ships or focus down the ship on
	its own with both of yours.

DOGFIGHT_TRAINING_INTRO2_TITLE: Goal
DOGFIGHT_TRAINING_INTRO2_TEXT: <<|
	You complete the simulation when all enemy ships are destroyed. You lose
	if you run out of ships first.

	Nicely done! One more enemy ship to go and your ships will level up making
	them stronger. In the mean time, you should regroup and let your ships
	recover. Hyperdrives are very useful for quick getaways! Shame we can't
	work out how to build them ourselves.

DOGFIGHT_TRAINING_PROGRESS2_TITLE: Defense
DOGFIGHT_TRAINING_PROGRESS2_TEXT: <<|
	Now you're out of harm's way you should take advantage of the support fleet
    building up on your planets. Transfer them to your ships to get an edge for
    the last battle.

	That's how you do it! I wish you good luck commanding the fifth Terra
	expedition force.

// A mining colony from a previous Terra expedition have been
// pleading for help to defend themselves again an onslaught of robots
// No one else wanted to try out our new Terra manufactured prototype
// hyperdrives so you're up. The colony say the robots are very vulnerable to
// planetary bombardment, so we've hooked your fleets up with loads of the stuff.
// You'll have to carve out your own trade network from the systems you siege
// Keep in mind that until you get a factory up and running you won't be able
// to replace any lost fleets so you'll have to engage carefully.
