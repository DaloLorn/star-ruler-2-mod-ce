	Congratulations recruit, you've almost made your way to becoming a commander
	of the Terra expedition force. Over the last few centuries we've had a number
	of mutinies and minor squabbles, so we introduced some mandatory dogfight
	training for all commanders.

	Your task is very simple. Win an outmatched dogfight in our simulator
	to prove your skills.

	As you can see, it's 3 versus 2 and your ships are identical to the enemy.
	You're going to need to get behind their ships or focus down the ship on
	its own with both of yours.

DOGFIGHT_TRAINING_INTRO2_TITLE: Goal
DOGFIGHT_TRAINING_INTRO2_TEXT: <<|
	You complete the simulation when all enemy ships are destroyed. You lose
	if you run out of ships first.

	Nicely done! One more enemy ship to go and your ships will level up making
	them stronger. In the mean time, you should regroup and let your ships
	recover.

	Hyperdrives are very useful for quick getaways! Shame we can't
	work out how to build them ourselves.

DOGFIGHT_TRAINING_PROGRESS2_TITLE: Defense
DOGFIGHT_TRAINING_PROGRESS2_TEXT: <<|
	Now you're out of harm's way you should take advantage of the support fleet
    building up on your planets. Transfer them to your ships to get an edge for
    the last battle.

MINING_COLONY_NAME: Mining Colony
MINING_COLONY_DESC: <<|
	[b]2463 CE:[/b]

	[i]The following message was received from the Terra mining colony directed
	to the commander of the 5th Terra Expedition.[/i]

	[offset=20][color=#ddd]We heard you are leading the next expedition force.
	Great! The mining colony you'll pass through on your way is in need of
	attention.

	Our miners don't really understand what they're doing, they're mining ore
	but not sending it anywhere. Please stop by and sort things out for us.

	Also there seems to be some kind of self replicating non organic activity
	in the edges of the colony. You should probably check that out while you're
	here.

MINING_COLONY_INTRO_TITLE: Mining Colony
MINING_COLONY_INTRO_TEXT: <<|
	[i]General Nova:[/i]

	Look, I know fixing up some mismanaged mining colony might not be the most
	glamorous start to your career, but we all have to start somewhere.

	The colonists seemed to forget that dyson swarms need continual ore
	supplies to operate at full efficiency. You're been donated several mining
	ships to fix up this colony with.

	Start by selecting one of your mining ships near the dyson.

MINING_COLONY_INTRO2_TITLE: Dysons need ore
MINING_COLONY_INTRO2_TEXT: <<|
	[i]General Nova:[/i]

	With a mining ship selected, right click it and tell it to 'Loop Subsequent
	Orders'. Then right click Avarita IV, and tell it to 'Pickup Ore.
	With the ship still selected, hold shift then right click Avarita VII and
	tell it to 'Transfer All Ore'.

MINING_COLONY_INTRO3_TITLE: Exploration
MINING_COLONY_INTRO3_TEXT: <<|
	[i]General Nova:[/i]

	Now your energy production is in full operation you may as well explore.
	All that energy will be useful for getting water out of the comets lying
	around.

	If there are hostiles just get rid of them and try not to lose all our
	planets. Mining ships are cheap enough to replace but if we lose all our
	colonies we'll be set back tremendously.
>>

MINING_COLONY_INTRO4_TITLE: Hostiles
MINING_COLONY_INTRO4_TEXT: <<|
	[i]General Nova:[/i]

	Before any combat you'll want to retrofit your fleets to be
	more heavily armored. Starting with your own flagship, of course. Can't
	run an expedition if you're dead after all

	[i]Add more armor to the Heavy Carrier design in the design tab,
	click save, select your flagship, and then right click Avarita IV and select
	'Retrofit Fleet'. Do not move the flagship out of the system until the
	retrofit is finished.

	[i]General Nova:[/i]

	Aaargh! I said we'd be in trouble if we lost all the mining colonies.
	The politicians back home decided to cut our funding way back. I'm going
	to have to take a huge pay cut for this. Oh, how about you? You're fired.
