OERR_SYSTEM: Cannot build orbitals outside systems except on self.
OERR_SYSTEM_NO_DEEP_SPACE: Cannot build this orbital outside systems on self
BATTLEWORLD_ORBITAL: Coordinate Satellite
BATTLEWORLD_ORBITAL_DESC: Fleets fight at 60% effectiveness when nearby owned planets, and down to 10% when far away.
FTL_EXTRACTOR: FTL Hyperfield Extractor
FTL_EXTRACTOR_DESC: <<
	A massive orbital that extracts FTL energy from the hyperfield. The process is stable, but difficult to keep under control during conflict.

	[img=$FTL;20/] +0.3 FTL/s after 3 minute ramp up

	[b][color=#ff8080]Extremely low health.[/color][/b]
>>
FTL_EXTRACTOR_BLURB: [img=$FTL;20/] +0.3 FTL/s
ORB_HYDROPONICS_SATELLITE_DESC: <<
	A satellite equipped with high-yield zero-G hydroponics bays growing genetically modified crops in exposure to direct sunlight.

	Must be constructed in orbit of a planet.

	The planet this is in orbit of gains 1 Food resource.

	Costs 150 Energy to construct in addition to its build cost.
>>
DYSON_SPHERE: Dyson Sphere
DYSON_SPHERE_BLURB: <<
	Extracts vast amounts of energy from a star's light
	[b][img=ResourceIconsSmall::65;20/] [color=#91692c]Ore Used:[/color][/b][offset=150]3 / second[/offset]
	[color=#aaa][i]Provides 2000 ore storage capacity[/i][/color]
>>
DYSON_SPHERE_DESC: <<
	Encases a star in photovoltic materials to absorb almost all of its light and convert it to vast quantities of energy

	[img=ResourceIconsSmall::11;22;#91692c][b][color=#91692c]Building a dyson sphere requires large amounts of Ore mined from asteroids, and additional ore per second for full efficiency.[/color][/b][/img]

RESOURCE_CLASS_Photovoltics: Photovoltic cells
LOW_ORBIT_DEFENSE_GRID: Reduces the population loss from planetary bombardment by 75%.
ORB_DEFENSE_SATELLITE_BLURB: Increases support strength, fires missiles, allows independent support action.
ORB_DEFENSE_SATELLITE_DESC: <<
	A military satellite constructed in low planetary orbit grants improved defensive capabilities to the planet and its support ships.

	Must be constructed in orbit of a planet.

	Support ships assigned to this planet fight at increased combat strength, and can independently move across the system in order to attack enemy fleets. Support ships set to Shield, Support or Artillery behavior will not leave the planet's orbit.

	Costs 500 Energy to construct in addition to its build cost.

	Only one tactical satellite may be constructed in orbit of every planet.

MINI_WORMHOLE: Wormhole Network
WORMHOLE_NETWORK_CONTROL_HUB: Wormhole Network Control Hub
WORMHOLE_NETWORK_CONTROL_HUB_DESC: <<
	Maintains a small wormhole, linking parts of space together.

	[i]Very fragile, and disabled if FTL is blocked.[/i]
>>
WORMHOLE_NETWORK_CONTROL_HUB_BLURB: Maintains a small wormhole
ORB_MAINFRAME_REV_DESC: <<
	Maintains the link of individual fleets to the collective network.

	Fleets near mainframes fight with increased strength.

	Fleets far away from mainframes fight with significantly weakened strength.

	The mainframe's weapons will only fire when it is currently in allied territory.

	Mainframes have small ion thrusters that allow it to move slowly.

	[i][color=#aaa]Range indicator is breakeven point, fleets inside will be stronger, fleets outside weaker.[/color][/i]
>>
ORB_SENATORIAL_PALACE_DESC: <<
	A grand palace for galactic senate members to use for diplomatic business.

	Can only be constructed if you are currently the Senate Leader.

	All other empires gain vision over the system the Senatorial Palace is in.

	You can use influence to purchase Election, Galactic Superpower and Galactic Utopia cards at the Senatorial Palace, which allow for an influence victory when played appropriately.

	[i][color=#aaa]If the Palace leaves owned space any active Galactic Superpower or Galactic Utopia votes and effects will be cancelled.[/color][/i]
