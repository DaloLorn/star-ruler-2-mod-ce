BATTLEWORLD_ORBITAL: Coordinate Satellite
BATTLEWORLD_ORBITAL_DESC: Fleets fight at 60% effectiveness when nearby owned planets, and down to 10% when far away.
FTL_EXTRACTOR: FTL Hyperfield Extractor
FTL_EXTRACTOR_DESC: <<
	A massive orbital that extracts FTL energy from the hyperfield. The process is stable, but difficult to keep under control during conflict.
