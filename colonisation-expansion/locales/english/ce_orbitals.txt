BATTLEWORLD_ORBITAL: Coordinate Satellite
BATTLEWORLD_ORBITAL_DESC: Fleets fight at 60% effectiveness when nearby owned planets, and down to 10% when far away.
FTL_EXTRACTOR: FTL Hyperfield Extractor
FTL_EXTRACTOR_DESC: <<
	A massive orbital that extracts FTL energy from the hyperfield. The process is stable, but difficult to keep under control during conflict.

	[img=$FTL;20/] +0.3 FTL/s

ORB_HYDROPONICS_SATELLITE_DESC: <<
	A satellite equipped with high-yield zero-G hydroponics bays growing genetically modified crops in exposure to direct sunlight.

	Must be constructed in orbit of a planet.

	The planet this is in orbit of gains 1 Food resource.

	Costs 150 Energy to construct in addition to its build cost.

DYSON_SPHERE: Dyson Sphere
DYSON_SPHERE_BLURB: Extracts vast amounts of energy from a star's light
DYSON_SPHERE_DESC: <<
	Encases a star in photovoltic materials to absorb almost all of its light and convert it to vast quantities of energy

	[img=ResourceIconsSmall::11;22;#91692c][b][color=#91692c]Building a dyson sphere requires large amounts of Ore mined from asteroids.[/color][/b][/img]

RESOURCE_CLASS_Photovoltics: Photovoltic cells
LOW_ORBIT_DEFENSE_GRID: Reduces the population loss from planetary bombardment by 75%.
ORB_DEFENSE_SATELLITE_BLURB: Increases support strength, fires missiles, allows independent support action. Grants protection against carpet bombing.
ORB_DEFENSE_SATELLITE_DESC: <<
	A military satellite constructed in low planetary orbit grants improved defensive capabilities to the planet and its support ships.

	Must be constructed in orbit of a planet.

	Support ships assigned to this planet fight at increased combat strength, and can independently move across the system in order to attack enemy fleets. Support ships set to Shield, Support or Artillery behavior will not leave the planet's orbit.

	Costs 500 Energy to construct in addition to its build cost.

	Only one tactical satellite may be constructed in orbit of every planet.
