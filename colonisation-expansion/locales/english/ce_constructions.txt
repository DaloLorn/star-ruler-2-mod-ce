FRACTURED_MOON_BASE: Moon Base
CONS_FRACTURED_MOON_BASE_DESC: <<
	Moon bases can be built infinitely on fractured planets but do not increase maximum population and further damage the planet.

	Keeping a moon base running on an unstable planet is not straightforward, and costs 25k in maintenance.
>>
RAZE_PLANET: Raze Planet
CONS_MOON_BASE_DESC: <<
	Construct a large amount of infrastructure making more area available for placing buildings.

	Also adds 2 maximum population.
>>
DEVELOP_FOREST_FOOD: Develop forest
CONS_DYSON_SPHERE_UPGRADE: Upgrade Dyson Sphere
CONS_DYSON_SPHERE_UPGRADE_DESC: <<
	Increase the rate at which the Dyson Sphere generates energy.

	[img=ResourceIconsSmall::11;22;#91692c][b][color=#91692c]Requires large amounts of Ore mined from asteroids.[/color][/b][/img]

DEVELOP_TILES: Manually Develop Tiles
DEVELOP_TILES_DESC: <<
	20 undeveloped tiles will randomly be developed on the planet's surface.

	Or less, if fewer than 20 undeveloped tiles remain.

	[i][color=#aaa]Planets not yet fully forested will not build up enough Forestation cargo automatically to do this.[/color][/i]

FRACTURE_PLANET_DESC: <<
	Fractures the planet into many tiny pieces, losing all [color=#f00]buildings[/color], surface area, [color=#f00]resources[/color] and [color=#f00]population[/color]. The planet becomes comprised of many bits and pieces between atmosphere and a local asteroid field.

	Fractured Planets can build an infinite number of moons and generate ore over time, but are easily destroyed by further planetary damage.
