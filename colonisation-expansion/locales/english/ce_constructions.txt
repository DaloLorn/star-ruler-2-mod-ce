FRACTURED_MOON_BASE: Moon Base
CONS_FRACTURED_MOON_BASE_DESC: <<
	Smaller moon bases can be built infinitely on fractured planets but do not increase maximum population and further damage the planet.

	Keeping a moon base running on an unstable planet is not straightforward, and costs 25k in maintenance.
>>
RAZE_PLANET: Raze Planet
CONS_MOON_BASE_DESC: <<
	Construct a large amount of infrastructure making more area available for placing buildings.

	Also adds 2 maximum population.
>>
DEVELOP_FOREST_FOOD: Develop forest
CONS_DYSON_SPHERE_UPGRADE: Upgrade Dyson Sphere
CONS_DYSON_SPHERE_UPGRADE_DESC: <<
	Increase the rate at which the Dyson Sphere generates energy and consumes ore.

	[img=ResourceIconsSmall::11;22;#91692c][b][color=#91692c]Requires large amounts of Ore mined from asteroids.[/color][/b][/img]
>>
DEVELOP_TILES: Manually Develop Tiles
DEVELOP_TILES_DESC: <<
	20 undeveloped tiles will randomly be developed on the planet's surface.

	Or less, if fewer than 20 undeveloped tiles remain.

	[i][color=#aaa]Planets not yet fully forested will not build up enough Forestation cargo automatically to do this.[/color][/i]

ANCIENT_DEVELOP_TILES_DESC: <<
	20 undeveloped tiles will randomly be developed on the planet's surface.

	Or less, if fewer than 20 undeveloped tiles remain.
>>
FRACTURE_PLANET_DESC: <<
	Fractures the planet into many tiny pieces, losing all [color=#f00]buildings[/color], surface area, [color=#f00]resources[/color] and nearly all [color=#f00]population[/color]. The planet becomes comprised of many bits and pieces between atmosphere and a local asteroid field.

	Fractured Planets can build an infinite number of moons and generate ore over time, but are easily destroyed by further planetary damage.
>>
TAKE_PLANET_DESC: Eradicate the natives from this planet. This will give us full control over the planet's resource but grant substantial leverage against us.
MAKE_NEBULAE: Create Nebulae
MAKE_NEBULAE_DESC: <<
	Blowing up this Gas Giant in just the right way can spew its gases all over the system in a [b][color=$1]pretty color[/color][/b].

	[color=#f00]Planet will be destroyed[/color]
>>
EXPOSE_CORE_DESC: <<
	Through extensive drilling and explosives we can open up this planet's molten core, providing a valuable local Tier 2 resource.
	Unfortunately the process makes the planet inhospitable in the interim, reducing pressure capacity and max population by 12.

	[color=#aaa][i]The drilling is too dangerous on planets with oceans or ice, and hence not available.[/i][/color]
>>
EXPOSE_CORE: Expose Molten Core
CREATE_WATER: Synthesise Water
CREATE_WATER_DESC: Using a ludicrous amount of energy, hydrogen and oxygen we can create enough water for an entire planet, at the cost of the mostly controlled explosion [color=#f00]losing all the planet's existing resources.[/color]
CANCEL_FRACTURE: Abort Fracture
CANCEL_FRACTURE_DESC: <<
	Cancels the fracturing process, preventing the planet from being fractured

	Does not refund the cost.
>>
CANCEL_CREATE_WATER: Abort Water Synthesis
CANCEL_CREATE_WATER_DESC: <<
	Cancels the water synthesis process, preventing the planet from being terraformed.

	Does not refund the cost.
