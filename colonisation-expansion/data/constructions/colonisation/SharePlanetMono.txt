	Description: <<
		Elevate the natives to a mechanical form and befriend them, granting us access to their secrets. Unfortunately we will have to give up on using the planet resource we found here.

		[i][color=#aaa]Mechanoid cannot utilise the population growth bonus of Uplifited Native Life, but the effect will still be granted and will apply if taken over by another empire. Without Mechanoid influence the natives decide to go bio again or something.[/color][/i]
