# TODO List

This is primarily intended as a developer focused project planning list, rather than something to read. I'm making it public because it's easier for me to keep track of if its in the repository, and it still has some value as a 'where CE is going' indicator.

- Bug list / issues to fix
  - Port interdict movement fixes to mod pack once stress tested in a few multiplayer games
  - Stress test teaching of dummy resources to the AI
    - Can unhack Ancient AI components and CP once sure fully working (I think it properly tracks dummy resource changes now?)
  - Expansion AI Component
    - Reteach AI to colonise planets for non levelling purposes
      - Getting there in terms of trade link establishing, but still need pressure based colony code
    - Teach AI to make buildings following the existing hooks system for FTL capacity/income
    - Teach AI how to deal with all of its focuses having requirements it can't meet
    - Scuttle outposts which have ended up in a different region to where the AI created them
      - Thanks Illyia
    - Apply conditions AI hooks to all applicable statuses
    - Implement custom ColonizeAbility interface for Ancient AI empires
    - Make sure star children motherships run away from danger while on habitat missions!
    - Allow the AI to leapfrog over systems that aren't in their border if they are struggling to find a resource
      - Should help them avoid making megafarms when they just need to expand into more food
    - Make AI consolidate labor at one shipyard, not multiple
    - Refine Mechanoid ColonizeAbility to avoid building too many pops if going into debt
    - Port unobtanium code from Mechanoid component into Expansion component as a generic bit of knowledge for using with any unobtanium planet
      - Notably level 0 planets
    - Teach AI to use constructions to meet resource requests
    - Extend the hooks to Constructions and do the same as for Buildings where the AI considers AsCreatedResources directly
        - Teach AI to melt ice
        - Teach AI to make most of the constructions by extending the building hint code
    - General notes on AI issues to fix in rework
      - To fix in refactor of colonization and development code
        - Make AI idle Replicators that aren't building anything go colonise something rather than just sit around being useless
  - Auto researching an FTL unlock should not trigger the vote for the FTL unlock
  - Consider how much if any of the patched First empire stat buffs to port to the AI's heuristics for ship design
  - Possibly make the defense grids provide an effectiveness boost to supports in orbit of the planet
  - Move mass/repair/supply calaculations into a definitions file of helper functions
    - LeaderAI getSlowestSupportAccel
    - Support cap hook
    - LeaderAI leaderInit
    - Ship constructible support supply free
  - Planetary shielding in some way
  - Make auto import refresh when resources on already colonised planets become available
  - Make nebulae griefing not work while the planet is in combat.
  - Tweak tractor default design
  - Add Moons and Ore filters on planets tab
  - Fix vision bug where planets moving in deep space while unseen aren't losing their memories, even though the memory loss is working correctly for exiting a region unseen
  - Add better UI for when attempting to export/import resources and you can't
  - Investigate what happens to civilian trade ships when target is in deep space
  - Fix bug where ordering a battleworld to transfer resources onto another one causes the other one to abort its current movement commands
  - Rework the Flying trait downside so it is less severe
  - Constructions for Gas Giants to make them more useful late game
  - Teach AI to not put comets on worlds being razed
  - Prevent AI from deliberately researching/building FTL extractors if they don't have any FTL unlocked
    - This hurts the First AI's budget
  - Increase the resolution of the Helium 3 icon to make it clearer
  - Reenable wormhole networks once reworked to ensure they don't cause FPS drops
    - Replace beams with lines?
  - Make quickbar width configurable
  - Fix bug with ships becoming unretroffitable if the source retrofitting them gets destroyed before finishing
  - Fix map generation bugs with galaxy mirroring and gas/ice giants

- Not planned for any time soon
  - Work out how to allow planets to always build orbitals/stations in their local gravity well even if they're in deep space
  - Colonisation ships similar to Motherships for other races
  - AI code to build orbitals like Stations
  - Teach AI to scuttle unneeded FTL income orbitals
  - Consider what to do about the Star Children being locked out of a lot of things only available as buildings
    - Vanilla buildings that Star Children have no equivalents of
      - Megafarms, Hydrogenators, Research Complexes, Mueseums, Labor Storage, Space Elevator, Planetary Thruster
    - Buildings that Star Children already don't need or have alternatives to
      - FTL Storage, Megacities
    - Maybe add a way to push planets around with motherships?
  - Make autoexplore continue to work after all systems have been visited once (will also split off into own mod or community patch)
  - Consider making carpet bombing able to destroy tiles via the SurfaceGrid's destroyRandomTile method
  - Fix adding local asteroid field not applying asteroid graphics (think this was in community patch already)
  - Get the AI to play invasion properly
  - Stellar Lifting to obtain protoplanets directly
  - Teach AI to scout nebulae properly
  - Make Star Children habitats and uplifted planets interact a little better
  - Fix visual bug causing Drugs to appear to be filling the Light class requirement for planet levelling when they are not, probably related to dummy resources
    - This is a vanilla bug that seems to be due to drugs on the client side not refreshing when the resource they were previously filling is provided and the drug switches to providing a different resource server side
  -  Fix vanilla bug making planets that vision was obtained of through the Space Program trait erronously appear as level 255 until scouted
  - Make the random FTL unlock certain to not unlock the one you get from the vote (no idea what order they currently run in, or how to control the order)
  - Make warheads manually fired (no clue how to do this)
  - Some kind of tech stealing / reverse engineering mechanic to reduce snowballing a little
  - Provide a benefit for being the most supportive empire on FTL votes when all FTL tech is already unlocked

- Long term plans
  - Improving the AI
    - Things players can do but AI just doesn't right now
      - Create stations at all
      - Attempt to achieve the influence victory themselves
      - Fling battle stations
      - Use Motherships well
      - Mine asteroids for ore
      - Move asteroids and other resources around with tractor beams
      - Create battleworlds
      - Use slipstreams to speed up colony ships
      - Attack enemy territory that doesn't border AI's owned systems
      - Carpet bomb enemy planets (especially useful vs Mechanoid)
      - Use the tractor beam on Motherships to drag around an Outpost - hey presto my mothership can always fire its weapons and if the outpost gets shot down the labor cost to build a new one is low enough to queue up immediately
      - Use gates to coordinate surprise attacks on an enemy (the AI is already good at doing rapid attacks with Hyperdrives/Jumpdrives/Fling but gates and slipstreams aren't used as well here)
      - Immediately seek to destroy a player's Senatorial Palace if they start one of the Galatic votes that can achieve the influence victory
