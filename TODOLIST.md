# TODO List

This is primarily intended as a developer focused project planning list, rather than something to read. I'm making it public because it's easier for me to keep track of if its in the repository, and it still has some value as a 'where CE is going' indicator.

- Bug list / issues to fix
  - Let battleworlders transfer asteroids from mining bases onto planets
  - Stress test teaching of dummy resources to the AI
    - Can unhack Mechanoid and Ancient AI components and CP once sure fully
      working
  - Expansion AI Component
    - Apply weights based on distance from colonise sources when picking colonise targets
    - Actually colonise planets off the queue
    - Teach AI to pick and colonise high value planets to level up
    - Finish teaching AI to colonize planets for levelling others
      - Save colonize queues into tree structure so can abort if lose export target
    - Teach AI to optimistically start colonising the dependants for a colonise target if it doesn't have anything else to colonise
    - Teach AI to prune imports/exports on non focuses
    - Port colonisation penalty system
    - Teach AI to use buildings/constructions to meet resource requests
    - General notes on AI issues to fix in rework
      - To fix in refactor of colonization and development code
        - Prevent Mono AI repeatedly colonising a food planet and then abandoning it (cannot reproduce second time?)
        - Make AI idle Motherships/Replicators that aren't building anything go colonise something rather than just sit around being useless
        - Teach AI to deprioritise water/food colonisation if they have built a stockpile of unused ones
        - Teach AI to build outposts to bridge otherwise empty/useless systems
        - Make new component directly consider the AsCreatedResource hooks on buildings rather than going through the consider code, which is quite useless at   responding to levelling needs due to how generic it is.
          - Extend the hooks to Constructions and do the same
      - Teach AI to melt ice
      - Teach AI to make most of the constructions by extending the building hint code
  - Reduce the points the Parasite trait gives for razing planets
  - Add a conditions flag to SpawnPlanet hook to avoid spawning dyson spheres with conditions
  - Extend the design stats changes to apply per hex for First build mass increases
  - Constructions for Gas Giants to make them more useful late game
  - Make jumpdrive tractoring factor in tractor beam mass increase
  - battleworld QoL changes
    - finish port to CP
    - Fix bug with outposts getting repeat entries in the in-combat quickbar
  - Make it possible to transfer fixed amounts of cargo in lump sums and as recurring per second between cargo sources without using flagships, some kind of automated civillian transporters?
    - Consider adding ore maintenace costs for Dysons once this system is working
    - Consider creating orders to instruct a civillian ship to transfer a fixed quantity of cargo to another target for free (but with civillian ship transport risks and slowness)
  - Teach AI to not put comets on worlds being razed
  - Provide a benefit for being the most supportive empire on FTL votes when all FTL tech is already unlocked
  - Make the random FTL unlock certain to not unlock the one you get from the vote (no idea what order they currently run in, or how to control the order)
  - Prevent AI from deliberately researching/building FTL extractors if they don't have any FTL unlocked
    - This hurts the First AI's budget
  - Increase the resolution of the Helium 3 icon to make it clearer
  - Fix visual bug causing Drugs to appear to be filling the Light class requirement for planet levelling when they are not, probably related to dummy resources
    - This is a vanilla bug that seems to be due to drugs on the client side not refreshing when the resource they were previously filling is provided and the drug switches to providing a different resource server side
  - Consider integrating Darloth's NMP into CE https://github.com/darloth/SR2-NewMovement (low priority as the mods are currently compatible minus gravitron adjust)
  - Make InterdictMovement set a flag on the mover component to turn off self controlled motion rather than hack at modifying acceleration as it does in vanilla
  - Fix vanilla bug making planets that vision was obtained of through the Space Program trait erronously appear as level 255 until scouted

- Not planned for any time soon
  - Work out how should implement deep space trading
    - Lighting Systems need to create a mini region around their planet, with the location of the planet being regularly updated
    - However the current region system assumes regions don't move, and has some bookkeeping that it does to make indexing for regions fast
    - Either need a way to create mobile regions or allow planets with Lighting Systems to bypass region based trade logic
  - Colonisation ships similar to Motherships for other races
  - AI code to build orbitals like Outposts and Stations
  - Teach AI to scuttle unneeded FTL income orbitals
  - Teach Mechanoid AI to use FTL Breeder Reactors
  - StarChildren transfering of pop from Mothership -> Mothership
  - Consider what to do about the Star Children being locked out of a lot of things only available as buildings
    - Vanilla buildings that Star Children have no equivalents of
      - Megafarms, Hydrogenators, Research Complexes, Mueseums, Labor Storage, Space Elevator, Planetary Thruster
    - Buildings that Star Children already don't need or have alternatives to
      - FTL Storage, Megacities
    - Maybe add a way to push planets around with motherships?
  - Make autoexplore continue to work after all systems have been visited once (will also split off into own mod or community patch)
  - Consider making carpet bombing able to destroy tiles via the SurfaceGrid's destroyRandomTile method
  - Fix adding local asteroid field not applying asteroid graphics (think this was in community patch already)
  - Prevent the Star Children from attempting to build buildings on planets they are not allowed to do so, right now the buildings will not go past 0%, but you can still waste money trying.
  - Get the AI to play invasion properly
  - Stellar Lifting to replace obtaining protoplanets from seed ships

- Long term plans
  - Improving the AI
    - Things players can do but AI just doesn't right now
      - Create stations at all
      - Attempt to achieve the influence victory themselves
      - Fling battle stations
      - Use Motherships well
      - Mine asteroids for ore
      - Move asteroids and other resources around with tractor beams
      - Create battleworlds
      - Use slipstreams to speed up colony ships
      - Attack enemy territory that doesn't border AI's owned systems
      - Carpet bomb enemy planets (especially useful vs Mechanoid)
      - Use the tractor beam on Motherships to drag around an Outpost - hey presto my mothership can always fire its weapons and if the outpost gets shot down the labor cost to build a new one is low enough to queue up immediately
      - Use gates to coordinate surprise attacks on an enemy (the AI is already good at doing rapid attacks with Hyperdrives/Jumpdrives/Fling but gates and slipstreams aren't used as well here)
      - Immediately seek to destroy a player's Senatorial Palace if they start one of the Galatic votes that can achieve the influence victory
