# Colonisation Expansion

This is a mod for Star Ruler 2. I started this aiming to make planets feel more unique by providing several dillemas and surface modifying options based on their biomes. It is now growing into a mod that provides many features to make the game feel more rich without drastically changing the gameplay.

## Features

- Several biome based planet constructions
- Gas giants
- Additional subsystems/hulls for low maintence exploration ships
- Tweaks to motherships to make their max pop scale with size
- Dilemma conditions that appear on planets and force you to make hard decisions
- Completely reworked research grid with similar research grouped together
  - From games with my empire set to the AI I think the AI explores this tree pretty well even though the algorithm is aimless
- Massively nerfed ship stat bonuses from research
  - I found in many games of unmodded Star Ruler my ships were either orders of magnitude stronger than my opponent's or orders of magnitude weaker. Nerfing stat bonuses makes ships much closer in strength even if one empire is ahead in terms of eco/research. To get more powerful ships you actually have to have the economy to field larger ships rather than just stacking multipliers that turn ks of combat strength into Ms of combat strength for free. I haven't done any full playthroughs yet so balance is very far from final.
- Ability to unlock all types of FTL and FTL income orbital from the research grid
  - For balancing this is a costly research path to go down and provides few other benefits. Each unlock also starts a vote to give the technology to all empires. This makes getting extra FTL technology a tradeoff as you might not keep it exclusive to just you, and then your research points have been wasted on something your opponents got for free.
- Supplementary new FTL
  - Jumpdrives for Stations
- Biology traits such as Aquatic or Flying
- New race featuring the Celestial biology trait that makes every planet able to be a battleworld (at great cost to your budget)
  - I recommend playing Celestial with the Terrestrial or Extragalactic lifestyles and with Slipstreams or Gates as your FTL
    - I'd like to add user interface improvements to make it easier to select multiple planets at once, as when every planet can be given move orders it is a bit of a pain to do them individually or after holding CTRL and selecting everything first.
- Improved AI
  - AI can handle the main dillema this mod adds
  - AI will build moon bases on Gas Giants unless it's playing as Star Children or Ancient and thus doesn't need to
  - AI can handle having multiple FTL abilities unlocked at once
    - Many more improvements on AI FTL usage planned
- WIP Fixes for bugs that have been introduced by new features (blocking alpha release)
  - Prevent dillemas occuring multiple times
  - FTL research votes occuring multiple times after previously passing
- Not planned for alpha release
  - Stations that can hold population
  - Colonisation ships similar to Motherships for other races
  - Mechanoid support for main dillema
  - AI code to understand biome constructions
  - AI code to build orbitals like Outposts and Stations

  Version alpha is still weeks away and then I will have to playtest to get any idea of balancing. I do not recommend playing any serious games with this mod yet as it is far from ready.
